## Description 
This application is a tool to track workouts - both cardio and resistance. It can be used to track progress, and compare your workouts throughout the week.

## Instructions 
As the app is loaded, the user will be prompted to either add an excersize to a new workout, or an existing current workout. Then, a new form appears, where the user enters the type of workout, duration, and other pertinent information to track. Once the workout is complete, the user can finish their workout and view stats and data on the previous workouts in the week.
